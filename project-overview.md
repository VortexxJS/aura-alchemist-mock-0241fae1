# Project Overview

Project Name: Aura Alchemist (Mock)

Description: A web application that simulates the creation of personalized color palettes based on a user's photo. The "aura reading" is mocked, and the app allows users to apply the palettes to mockups of digital designs, home decor, and fashion styles.

Features:
*   Photo Upload and Mock "Aura Reading": Allow users to upload a photo and display a pre-determined "aura" based on a set of hardcoded options.
*   Color Palette Generation: Assign a hardcoded color palette to each "aura."
*   Application Mockups: Provide mockups for digital designs, home decor, and fashion styles where users can apply the generated palettes.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
